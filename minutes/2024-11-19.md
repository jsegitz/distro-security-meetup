  QA round (incomplete):
  - Post event improvement round every time?
    Not every event. Only on major events or if things to
    south

  - Ability to set different severity per product?
    Is only used sometimes

  - do you look at other Distros ratings
    Yes

  - Major incident workflow. How to decide how to trigger?
    Formalized process involving multiple people

  - Do you take into account how customers use the software?
    For libraries assume worst case, for other packages varied approach
    Sometimes sent CVSS rescore requests to NVD
    Score some CVSS as 0 instead of rejecting CVEs

  - Assumption that everything get fixed by auditors
    RH also receives push back on this

  - Cloud LTs group for kernel CVE: combined efforts to score the CVEs and what is affected
    Bring up next time again
