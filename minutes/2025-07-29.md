Standing topics:

- Conferences members visit to meet up, e.g.
  - FOSDEM
  - https://events.linuxfoundation.org/linux-security-summit-europe/

  Sent conferences you join to the mailing list if you're interested to meet up

  - For bigger groups organize a room
  - For smaller groups: Just meet for a beer

Topics:

- Move meeting start by 5 minutes?
  Yes

- Generic hardening (compile flags, kernel parameter, default configurations for servers, ...)

  Norbert Manthey

  SUSE: compile flags rather easy, kernel changes not so much
  Try to make them runtime configurable

  Canonical disabled mitigations for Intel hardware issues.
  Cost 20%. Customers seem to be very happy about this

  Oracle: Split kernel modules into multiple packages. Only deploy
  minimal set of kernel modules

  AWS: Changing compiler flags in existing distributions is hard

  SUSE has a patch to record used compiler flags in the debug packages

  Trickle down strategy: Do it in the bleeding edge/rolling distributions
  then get it into products this way

- CVE woes

  No reaction from CVE board. Tried email and linkedin

  AI Sam: Help out

  Chris Gordon knows someone there an can also help

- GCVE initiative (Guest Alexandre Dulaunoy of CIRCLE)
  Not available in July, contact again in September
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va3almPab1M

- Next meeting: September, August will be skipped

- Oracle presentation (David Fernandez Gonzalez)
  Data TBD

- Amazon Linux presentation (Amazon)

- Combined efforts to score the CVEs and check affectedness

  Reachability analysis via AI.

  No CVE bump caused by AI compared to fuzzing, showing limited impact
