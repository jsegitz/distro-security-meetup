Distribution security team meetup
============
This is an attempt to improve the collaboration of the security teams of various distributions.

Why
============
Basically the XZ incident. The challenges that threats like these raise are
huge and no single team will be able to tackle all of the necessary tasks.

We all work on a common/similar code base and therefor it
seems logical to try to identify opportunities for cooperation.

Possible topics include
- Share information on how we work
- Identify areas of cooperation
- Avoid duplicate work
