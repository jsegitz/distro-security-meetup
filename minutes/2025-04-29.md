Topics:

- Amazon Linux presentation
  Have to skip it, not sure it if this will happen

- Debian jumped in (Moritz Muehlenhoff)
  ~8 people currently active
  usually trying to involve the maintainers

  Everything in the open

  Some automatic filtering for software they don't ship based on software and CNAs

  Have an emacs mode to work on the remaining cases

  security-tracker.debian.org has an explanation for the formats used

  Community security team for three years, afterwards crowd effort for longer support.  Five years for the entire distribution (apart from some exceptions like Firefox).  Five to ten years depending on what is requested/funded

  Do not involve maintainers if it's a private issue. They get significant user contributions

  Guidance via tooling to sent bugs privately

  Debian is a CNA, but with a strict scope

  For private issues they have a private build infrastructure

  Testing infrastructure used for regression testing based on dependencies

  Some security issues are ignored. E.g. low impact, breaking change

  How much time do the 8 core people spent on this per day? ~10 hours/week

  Debian doesn't offer severity information or CVSS score
