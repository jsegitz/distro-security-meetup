  Sent conferences you join to the mailing list if you're interested to meet up

  - For bigger groups organize a room
  - For smaller groups: Just meet for a beer

Topics:

- GCVE initiative (Guest Alexandre Dulaunoy, and Xavier Claude of CIRCLE)

  https://github.com/jsegitz/distro-security-meetup/blob/main/slidedecks/2025-11-25_GCVE.pdf

  Also demoed https://vulnerability.circl.lu/

  Questions:
  - Are there consumers already?
    Majority of users is for vulnerability management
  - autonomy is a great idea, obviously also has drawbacks
    Any rules on dropping GNAs? Flag misbehaving GNAs
    Do you indicate if a GNA follows best practices? Plan to do, maybe crowdsourced ranking
  - even a vulnerability researcher can become a GNA? worried about CVE Farming?

  SUSE wants to trial this in 2026 for CVEs that we assign

- Next meeting January, skipping December because of the holidays
