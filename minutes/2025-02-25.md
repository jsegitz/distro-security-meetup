  Guest: Bernhard Wiedemann, working on reproducible builds @ SUSE
  https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Reproducible_openSUSE

  Gave a presentation on his efforts. Some discussion on how this can be used
  for the idea Norbert outlined last time

- Handling testing during embargo (Salvatore Bonaccorso)

  Negative example: the rsync issue

  Distros list for review
  
  Sometimes not enough time, sometimes having more time leads to negative results because urgency is missing

  Problem for SUSE: Diffferene between community packer/SUSE packager. Embargoed information can't be shared
  with community.

  No clear way how to improve in the general case.

  AI: Johannes check fro openQA test cases and share with list

- Combined efforts to score the CVEs and check affectedness
  Postponed to next meeting
