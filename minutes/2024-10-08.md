Topics:
- Tooling/orga setup of this group
  Minutes etc. will be collected in
  https://github.com/jsegitz/distro-security-meetup
  I'll add you to the repo next meeting. It's quite annoying just doing this based on the list of names here
  
- Presentation from Canonical about their way of working (Mark Esler)
  Slides: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18_8LIujvjFBMEbd_trxLgTqvXS3mnkKb8wnwu7grizc/edit#slide=id.g29228888b6b_0_0

- Issue with coordinated disclosure. Sometimes tricky to get hold of people.  Do you experience the same issues?
  Would it be helpful to have a way to coordinate this better (maybe via this group)?

  In general yes. One option could be VINCE or do it fully in the open (e.g. oss sec)

- Extend RPM Specfile with additional meta data, e.g. package repo URL, commit ID hash, release archive creation command(s) (Norbert Manthey)
